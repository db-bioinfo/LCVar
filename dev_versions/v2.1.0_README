Key improvements:

ClinGen-calibrated thresholds from VarSome's methodology for all predictors
Evidence strength scaling (Supporting=1, Moderate=2, Strong=4, Very Strong=8)
Meta-predictor hierarchy to prevent double-counting
Proper LOF exclusion to avoid conflicts with PVS1
Conservation metrics as fallback evidence
Splicing predictions with appropriate thresholds
