1. PVS1 - Loss of Function (Highest Priority)

Current: Basic LOF detection with SnpEff integration
Need: Full ClinGen SVI 2018 decision tree implementation including:

NMD prediction beyond simple annotation parsing
Exon position analysis (last exon, last 50bp rules)
Alternative start codon rescue assessment
Biologically relevant transcript selection
Strength modulation (PVS1_Strong, PVS1_Moderate, PVS1_Supporting)
